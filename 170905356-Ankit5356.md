According to a survey around 60 percent people, in india, don't have access to private toilets. Thus the only option left for them 
is to defecate in open. Hence this overwhelming majority not having access to sanitary facilities, for sure poses an obstacle in the 
development of the nation.

## Currenlty India is on the biggest toilet-building spree in human history
           After becoming the prime minister in 2014, Narender Modi signaled that sanitation would be a top most priority in his 
social programe. Following his manifesto, in the month of October , same year, he introduced the **Swachh Bharat Abhiyan** or **The 
Clean India Campaign**.
It was basically a raft of public appeals and policies which aimed in creating a "Clean India" by the end of his government's term. 
Corporate support was commandeered to reduce open defecation, and for this he alloted *$20 billion* with an aim of constructing 
*111 million latrines* or toilets in five years.

Inspite of the intense efforts and pressure being put up by the government, we have not recieved the desired result on the front
of cleanliness. An attitudinal change on the part of the citizens is a must, inorder to fullfill the mission in its true spirits.
