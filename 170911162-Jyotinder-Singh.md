# Swatchh Bharat Mission

#### The Swatchh Bharat Mission was started by the Narendra Modi government, that aimed to be the largest behaviour change campaign in the field of sanitation in the world

There have been:
- 8,51,80,706 household toilets built in Rural Areas
- 50,71,725 household toilets built in Urban Areas
- 395,200 public toilets built in Urban areas

Looking at these statistics, it is clear that change is coming. 
One of the other missions of this programme is to allow for better waste to energy conversion. Till now, **88.4 MW** of current production from solid waste has been achieved.

-I feel that this has marked the start of one of the most needed movements in our country, to fight Open Defecation, and it has been a grand success. In fact, Kerela has already been declared an open defecation free state.
