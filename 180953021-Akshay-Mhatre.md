## **'Cleanliness is next to Godliness'.**
A much needed movement at this point of time in India's timeline, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Swachh Bharat Mission is a nation-wide campaign
that was launched in India for the period 2014 - 2019 that aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India's cities, towns, and rural areas.
The campaign was officially launched on **2 October 2014** in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi at New Delhi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
It is India's largest cleanliness drive to date with three million government employees and students from all parts of India
participating in 4,041 cities, towns, and rural areas. 
The government has constructed **86 million toilets** since 2014, reducing the number of persons who openly defecate
from **550 million** to fewer than **1 million** in 2018. 
Unhygienic conditions is one of the major root cause of diseases / illness. This movement has an immensely positive impact on
India's health sector by not only minimizing the spread and causation of diseases but also cutting down huge unnecessary costs.
To conclude with a simple qoute from Lailah Gifty Akita:
> "*Clean communities, healthy citizens*"
